 1 Use a context manager for file operations to ensure proper closing.              
 2 Implement caching for get_vm_info function to reduce repeated file reads.        
 3 Use csv module for reading the inventory file instead of manual parsing.         
  4 Implement parallel processing for extract_vm_info function.                     
  5 Use aiofiles for asynchronous file I/O operations.                              
  6 Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for run_az_command.              
  7 Use asyncio.gather with chunking for better control over concurrency in main    
    function.                                                                       
  8 Implement logging using the logging module instead of custom write_log function.
  9 Use aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests instead of subprocess calls to az    
    CLI.                                                                            
 10 Implement error handling and input validation for user inputs.                  
 11 Use typer or click for better CLI interface and argument parsing.               
 12 Implement a configuration file for default values and settings.                 
 13 Use dataclasses or NamedTuple for structured data instead of tuples.            
 14 Implement a custom exception hierarchy for better error handling.               
 15 Use functools.lru_cache for memoization of repetitive function calls.
